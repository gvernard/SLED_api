    "The minimum information required to upload a lens is the RA, DEC, and an image. Coordinates should be in decimal degrees and in the J2000 system. To convert from ra/dec in hours-minutes/degrees-minutes, you can use the astropy coords functionality. The lens image can be in <code>.png, .jpg, or .jpeg</code> format. It is recommended to restrict access to the uploaded lenses by setting <code>'access_level'='PRI'</code> (or just omitting this field). Additional fields can be added to each lens, as described in the [SLED guide](https://sled.amnh.org/sled_guide/#object-specs-lens)."
