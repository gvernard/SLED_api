In addition to these fields, the RA and DEC of the associated lens must be given. Coordinates should be in decimal degrees and in the J2000 system. To convert from ra/dec in hours-minutes/degrees-minutes, you can use the astropy coords functionality. The associated image can be in <code>.png, .jpg, or .jpeg</code> format. It is recommended to restrict access to the uploaded data by setting <code>'access_level'='PRI'</code> (or just omitting this field)."
