	<h2>Preparation</h2>
	<p>
	  You will need a <b>SLED user account</b>, at least the <b>RA and DEC</b> of your lenses, and an <b>image of each lens</b> (.jpeg, .png, or .jpg).
	  More details on all the different information that one can upload with each lens can be found in the <a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#object-specs-lens">guide</a>.
	  The recommended approach is to upload lenses as private (PRI) and then make them public at a later time once any mistakes will have been spotted and fixed.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2>A few lenses</h2>
	<p>
	  If you have only a handful of new lenses to inject, then use the <a href="{% url 'lenses:lens-add' %}">web interface</a>.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2>Large numbers of lenses</h2>
	<p>
	  Using the web interface for uploading more than a handful of lenses can be impractical.
	  There is the alternative option to upload lenses using scripts from the command line or from ipython notebooks.
	  Just follow these two steps:
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      Use this <a href="https://github.com/gvernard/SLED_api/blob/master/examples/howto_simple_query.ipynb" target="_blank">simple query script</a> to perform a query to the database at your RA,DEC.
	      This will identify any lenses from your sample that may already exist in the database.
	      If such lenses are found, then before injecting your sample you may:
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  Remove them from your sample completely (you can still suggest updates to the existing ones or add data). <u>This is the recommended approach</u>.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Inject them anyway and resolve the duplicate entries via the website functionality.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Use this <a href="https://github.com/gvernard/SLED_api/blob/master/examples/howto_upload_lenses.ipynb" target="_blank">upload script</a> to inject your lenses in the database.
	      The script reports any conflicts, such as duplicates within your sample, non-matching coordinates, etc, that need to be resolved before uploading.
	      You are free to choose which other SLED fields you want to include, besides the RA, DEC, and a lens image.
	      It is recommended to upload the lenses with <b>restricted (private) access (PRI)</b>, in order to avoid any mistakes.
	    </li>
	  </ol>	  
	</p>
	
	
	<h2>Final steps</h2>
	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <b>What's next?</b> - Upon successful upload, the new lenses will appear in your <a href="{% url 'sled_users:user-profile' %}">user profile</a>.
	      You will be the owner of these lenses and responsible for keeping them up-to-date.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <b>Private vs Public</b> - If you uploaded your lenses with private access (PRI), then you can select which other users or groups are able to see them.
	      You can either do this for each lens individually by clicking the 'Give access' button on its page, or select several lenses from your <a href="{% url 'sled_users:user-profile' %}#lenses">user profile</a> lens tab and click the ‘Give access’ button at the bottom of the page.
	      Any lenses that are uploaded as public (PUB) will need to be visually confirmed by another SLED user with the role of an <a href="{% url 'sled_users:user-query' %}?role=Inspector">Inspector</a>.
	      They are termorarily injected in the database as private and will be made available to all SLED users as soon as the related <a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#task-inspect-images">Inspect Images</a> task is completed.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <b>A collection of your new lenses</b> - You can optionally use <a href="https://github.com/gvernard/SLED_api/blob/master/examples/howto_create_collection.ipynb" target="_blank">this script</a> to create a SLED collection with the lenses you just uploaded (or you can do it by hand from your user profile page).
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<br>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="c c-user">

	  How to inject data associated to lenses?
	</label>
      </h1>
      <div class="p">
	<br>
	<h2>Preparation</h2>
	<p>
	  You will need a <b>SLED user account</b> and the lenses for which you want to upload data, e.g. have them gathered in a collection or know their <b>RA and DEC</b> (you don't have to be the owner of the lenses in order to upload and associate data to them).
	  There are 6 types of data that can be associated to lenses, each with its own fields described in detail in the guide:
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#object-specs-imaging">Imaging data</a></li>
	    <li><a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#object-specs-spectrum">Spectrum</a></li>
	    <li><a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#object-specs-catalogue">Catalogue data</a></li>
	    <li><a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#object-specs-redshift">Redshift</a></li>
	    <li><a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#object-specs-redshift">Generic Image</a></li>
	    <li><a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#object-specs-redshift">Lens Model</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  The more of these fields that can be injected in SLED the better.
	  The mandatory fields for each type are included in the example scripts below and will be indicated during submission time (if missing) through the website or API.
	  The recommended approach is to upload data as private (PRI) and then make them public at a later time once any mistakes will have been spotted and fixed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <u><b>NOTE:</b> SLED automatically fetches some data for newly injected lenses as described in the <a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}">guide</a>.</u>
	</p>


	<h2>A few images, spectra, etc</h2>
	<p>
	  A typical use case is having just a few images, redshifts, etc, that you are trying to inject for a single, or a few lenses.
	  The best way to achieve this is to go directly to each lens page on the website, e.g. for <a href="https://sled.amnh.org/lenses/detail/5">Q2237+0305</a>, and click on the 'Add imaging data', 'Add redshift', etc, buttons.
	</p>


	<h2>Mass data injection</h2>
	<p>
	  When lots of data needs to be added for several lenses, then the best approach is to use scripts from the command line or ipython notebooks.
	  Matching data to existing lenses happens through their <b>RA and DEC</b>, which should uniquely identify a lens in SLED.
	  Follow these two steps: 
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      Use this <a href="https://github.com/gvernard/SLED_api/blob/master/examples/howto_simple_query.ipynb" target="_blank">simple query script</a> to perform a query to the database at your RA,DEC.
	      This will ensure that all the lenses that you are adding data to exist in the database.
	      If some lenses are missing, then follow the instructions on <a href="#how-to-inject-lenses">how to inject new lenses</a> first.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Use these scripts to upload each type of data:
	      <ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/gvernard/SLED_api/blob/master/examples/howto_upload_imaging_data.ipynb" target="_blank">Imaging data</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/gvernard/SLED_api/blob/master/examples/howto_upload_spectra.ipynb" target="_blank">Spectrum</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/gvernard/SLED_api/blob/master/examples/howto_upload_redshifts.ipynb" target="_blank">Redshift</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/gvernard/SLED_api/blob/master/examples/howto_upload_generic_images.ipynb" target="_blank">Generic Image</a></li>	
		<li>Catalogue data - can only be uploaded by the admins for now</li>
		<li>Lens Model - coming soon</li>
	      </ul>
	      The scripts will report any conflicts, such as missing fields, non-matching coordinates, wrong values, etc, that need to be resolved before uploading.
	      It is recommended to upload the data with <b>restricted (private) access (PRI)</b>, in order to avoid any mistakes.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</p>


	<h2>Final steps</h2>
	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <b>What's next?</b> - Upon successful upload, the fresh data will appear in your user profile under the respective tab, e.g. <a href="{% url 'sled_users:user-profile' %}#generic-images">here for Generic Images</a>.
	      You will be the owner of these data and responsible for keeping them up-to-date.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <b>Private vs Public</b> - If you uploaded your data with private access (PRI), then you can select which other users or groups are able to see them; locate the respective tab ('Imaging data', 'Sepctra', etc) in your <a href="{% url 'sled_users:user-profile' %}">user profile</a> page, select several objects that you want to share with other users and groups, and click the 'Give access' button at the bottom.
	      If you uploaded Imaging data, Spectra, or Generic Images with public access (PUB) then they will be temporarily stored as private.
	      The reason is that, similarly to lenses, their associated images will need to be inspected and approved by another SLED user with the role of an <a href="{% url 'sled_users:user-query' %}?role=Inspector">Inspector</a>.
	      They will be made available to all SLED users as soon as the related <a href="{% url 'sled_guide:sled-guide' %}#task-inspect-images">Inspect Images</a> task is completed.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
